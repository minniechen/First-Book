Background
We are at IT/Internet software company. As a team lead or project owner, are your team members all independent or proactive? I think the answer is "NO". Today, our topic is that "How to improve it?".

Examples
Scenario 1
As a QA: he takes a complex task during his work. When he encounters some blocked issues and will escalate to his lead. He lists the detail without key point, or the key point is not clear.

Issue: as a team lead/members, how to give the feedback efficiently?

Solution:

1.Analyze the reason and ask him to list key point first.

Refer to the related Doc.

Guide/facilitate him first and set the expected for the next time when he meets the same issue.

4.Encourage him to write the solution in wiki or doc and share with other team members.

Kudos：when he does better than expected.

Waring：when the result is not good or bad.

Scenario 2
As a QA: we have to finish assigned tasks everyday. Sometimes there is an additional/ hot task, some one has buffers, some one doesn't.

Issue: how to facilitate team member to take additional/hot task proactively?

Solution:

Increase team's transparency
a. Rotate the release owner.

b. Ask the detail offline and encourage them to task more

During planning, encourage team member initiate to take tasks
3.Weekly/retrospective meeting: kudos all the team
